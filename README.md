## Project Name: Fibonacci Sequence Timer
***

### Oct. 3rd, 2022 -- https://github.com/CCulp2/FibonacciDocumented
***

### Project Requirements: 
- Implement the Fibonacci Sequence to the nth position iteratively and recursively.
- Track the runtime efficiency over several runs.
- Complete Chart comparing the timing.

### Milestones and est. time: 
- Implement Fib sequence iteratively – 10 min.
- Implement Fib sequence recursively – 20 min.
- Add precise timing to each run – 5 min.
- Format timing in easy-to-read format – 1 hour.
- Create chart out of timings – 15 min.

### Stretch Goals:
- Create a history of prior timings. – 30 min.
- Automatically create Chart from Java – Unknown.

### Risk - Mitigation:
- Unable to create chart from Java – Create output that can be used to make chart by hand.
***
### Missed Goals: 
- Automatically create chart from Java.

### Areas/questions for discussion:

- Is the first jump in compute time due to debug compilation?
- How could I have automatically created a chart from the language itself?

### Aftermath / Future lessons: 
- Create the output first. I spent too much time on changing the formatting of the output to be easy to read.
- Re-inventing the wheel. I should have checked for an option to make a CSV file / chart before I
    began to program.

## Project Abstract

### Part I.

Implement the Fibonacci function in both a recursive and iterative fashion. What’s the runtime efficiency of each?
You can look up sample programs - there are many out there - but for your own experience, please type yours from scratch.
Turn in a chart of the results, with time on the Y axis, and input on the X axis, Please use nanosecond. long startTime =
System.nanoTime(); This chart must not be hand written.

### Part II.
Create documentation for your program. Use the best practices that you have learned in this module.
